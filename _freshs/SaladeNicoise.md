   - For dressing, shake together oil, vinegar, salt, pepper, chives, and parsley; chill.
   - Cook unpeeled potatoes in boiling, salted water 20 minutes, or until tender; cool immediately under cold water; peel and slice. Pout over just enough dressing to coat slices, mix lightly. Cover; chill at least 2 hours.
   - Cut off ends of beans and cut into 1½-inch lengths; cook in boiling salted water ~15 minutes or until crisp-tender; drain and cool immediately with cold water. Drain well again, then turn into a bowl and coat lightly with dressing. Cover and chill at least 2 hours.
   - Select a rimmed platter or large, shallow bowl and mound potato salad down the center. Arrange marinated green beans on each side. Peel tomatoes and cut in wedges. Quarter the hard cooked eggs and alternate egg quarters and tomato wedges beside the green beans. 
   - Garnish with olives and sprinkle with capers. Cover with foil or clear plastic film and chill until serving time. When ready to serve, add a border of the inside leaves of butter lettuce and pour remain dressing over them. Add tuna with watercress.
