directions: |
   - Line a baking sheet with wax paper.
   - In a large bowl, mix peanut butter, butter, vanilla, and sugar with your hands until smooth (It will be quite stiff).
   - Shape into balls by the teaspoon full- should be the size of a large marble. Place on the wax paper and refrigerate 30 minutes.
   - In the top of a double boiler, over simmering water, melt chocolate and shortening. Stir until smooth.
   - Remove peanut butter balls from fridge. Using a tooth pick or similar small skewer, stick into a ball and dip it into the chocolate until Â¼ of the balls is coated (I try to get the edge of the chocolate around the toothpick, so it flows to cover the hole when I remove the toothpick).
   - Return dipped ball to the wax paper and gently remove the toothpick (the ball could be flake off here). Repeat with all the balls.
   - Refrigerate at least 30 minutes until chocolate is firm.
   - To store, place in cover container with layer of wax paper between layers of buckeyes.
   - We have found that the smaller one-bite size seem to taste the best.
