   - In a large bowl, sift together flour, baking soda, cornstarch and salt.
   - In another bowl, whisk together brown sugar, granulated sugar, and melted butter. Whisk until the sugars have dissolved. Add in the egg and egg yolk and whisk. Then add vanilla extract.
   - Pour the wet ingredients into the dry. Use a large spoon to combine the ingredients together. Fold in chocolate chips.
   - Place the dough in the large bowl, cover, and chill in the fridge for at least 3 hours, preferably overnight.
   - When you’re ready to bake the cookies pre-heat the oven to 325°. Pull the dough out of the fridge and let sit for about 10 minutes.
   - Line baking sheets with parchment paper. The dough is going to be hard, and firm, and a little difficult to work with.
   - Use 3 tbsp of dough for each cookie. Use your hands to form the dough into balls. Press and few additional chocolate chips into the top of each ball.
   - Give each cookie a good amount of space on the baking sheets. Bake for 11-12 minutes. Cookies will appear under-baked.
   - Allow the cookies to cool for about 10 minutes before transferring them to wire-cooling racks to finish cooling.
   - They should stay fresh for about 7 days.  This batch makes about 16 cookies.
