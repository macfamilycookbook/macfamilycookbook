directions: |
   - Blanch bean in boiling water for 4 minutes or until tender but still bright green (don’t undercook – the beans must be tender and not too crisp for the correct texture); plunge beans into ice water, then drain. Pat dry with paper towers. (The beans can be prepared ahead up to this point, covered, and refrigerated until using.)
   - Heat oil in large nonstick skillet or preheated wok over high heat. When hot, add garlic and ginger; cook for a few seconds. Add beans, chili paste, and slat and stir-fry for 1 minute or until beans are coated and flavored with seasonings. Serves 2 to 4.
