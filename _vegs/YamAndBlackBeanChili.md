   - Warm the oil in a large pan over medium heat and add the onion, pepper, garlic, and yam chunks. Sauté, stirring often, until onions are soft, about 5 minutes.
   - Add the tomatoes, breaking them up with the back of a wooden spoon. Add water or stock, beans, smoked paprika, cumin, and chili powder, bring to boil, reduce heat to simmer, cover, and cook for 30 minutes, or until yams are tender. Stir in cilantro and serve.
