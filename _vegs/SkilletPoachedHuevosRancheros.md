   - In a large skillet, combine the salsa and beans and bring to a simmer.
   - Make 4 small wells in the bean mixture.  One at a time, crack each egg into a small bowl and slide it gently into a well.  Season with ½ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper. Cook, covered, over medium heat, 3 to 5 minutes for slightly runny yolks.
   - Sprinkle with the scallions and cilantro.  Serve with Tortillas and sour cream.
