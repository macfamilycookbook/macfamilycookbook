   - Put the whole eggplant as is (only cut and remove the stem from the top) on a baking sheet and bake it. You'll know when it's done when the juice comes out onto the baking sheet and the skin is almosted toasted and its soft when poked with a knife.
   - Let it cool for a bit then cut it in half and remove the skin; just cut it roughly into small/medium diced pieces and put it into the salad bowl (it's ok if it has some juice still). Then add the rest of the ingredients and mix the salad and serve. Best with pita bread on the side.
