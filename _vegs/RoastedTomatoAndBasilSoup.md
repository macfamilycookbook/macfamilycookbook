   - Preheat oven to 425°, strain tomatoes from juice, saving juice for later. Spray cooking spray over tin foil lined baking sheet. Add tomatoes; slide the garlic slivers into the tomatoes. Drizzle olive oil over the top, along with dried basil and salt and pepper. The tomatoes will toast and soften inside as well as infuse with flavor. Place in oven and roast for 30 min., don’t over roast.
   - Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in large soup pan over med. Heat. Add onion, carrot, and celery, cook until tender. Add garlic and stir for 30-45 seconds before adding chicken broth, reserved tomato juice and roasted tomatoes. Add bay leaf.
   - Cook over med/low heat for 2-3 hours.
   - In separate bowl add milk, slowly spoon a little bit of soup mixture into milk to warm (don’t pour cold milk in, it will curdle).
   - Once the bowl of milk is warm add it to the soup with the fresh basil. Remove bay leaf, add sugar and vinegar. Use immersion blender to blend until smooth.
