   - In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta according to package instructions; drain well.
   - Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and mushrooms, and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and browned, about 5-6 minutes. Whisk in flour until lightly browned, about 1 minute.
   - Gradually whisk in vegetable broth, rosemary, thyme and basil. Cook, whisking constantly, until incorporated, about 1-2 minutes. Stir in heavy cream, goat cheese and Parmesan until slightly thickened, about 1-2 minutes. If the mixture is too thick, add more vegetable broth as needed; season with salt and pepper, to taste.
   - Stir in pasta and gently toss to combine.
   - Serve immediately, garnished with chives, if desired.
