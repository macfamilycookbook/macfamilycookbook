   - Pour oil into a frying pan over medium heat; add onion and cook until limp. Then stir in the tomato sauce, garlic, chilies, cumin, oregano, and bay; simmer, uncovered, 10 minutes or until slightly thickened. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cool, cover, and chill as long as 25 hours if made ahead. Remove bay and reheat, uncovered, to simmering before serving.
   - Transfer cooked eggs to bowl filled with hottest tap water; let stand 5 minutes.
   - Peel, pit, and halve avocados; coat cut sides with lemon juice and arrange cup side up, in a 9-in pie pan. Lift eggs from hot water, drain briefly, and arrange 1 or 2 eggs on each avocado half. Spoon 1 to tablespoons of sauce over top and sprinkle evenly with cheese. Broil about 6 inches from heat, just until cheese is melted. Pass remain sauce to spoon over all. 
   - _Poached Eggs:_ Fill a wide pan with water to cover an egg by about 1 inch. Add 1 tablespoon vinegar for each quart water. Bring to simmer; reduce heat so no bubbles break on surface.
   - Break each egg into water; do not crowd. Cook until set to your liking, 3 to 5 minutes for soft eggs. With a slotted spoon, transfer eggs to cold water; cover and chill for 24 hours.
