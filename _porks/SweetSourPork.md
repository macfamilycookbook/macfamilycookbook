   - Prepare Sweet and Sour Sauce; set aside.
   - Dip pork cubes in beaten egg, drain briefly, and roll in cornstarch to coat lightly; shake off excess
   - Place a work over medium-high heat. When wok is hot, add 3 tablespoons of the oil. When oil is hot add half the pork and stir-fry until evenly browned (about 7 minutes); lift pork from work and set aside. Repeat to brown remaining meat, adding more oil as needed. 
   - Scrape away and discard any browned particles from sides and bottom of work, but leave oil in wok. If necessary, add more oil to wok to make about 2 tablespoons total. Place wok over high heat. When oil is hot, add onion, carrots, and garlic; stir-fry for about 1 minute. Add water and bell pepper; cover and cook, stirring frequently, for about 2 minutes. Add pineapple, tomatoes, and pork; stir Sweet and Sour Sauce, then add. Stir until mixture boils and thickens (about 1-minute)
