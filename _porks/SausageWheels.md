   - Following package directions, cook pasta in the boiling salted water just until barely tender.
   - Meanwhile, in a wide frying pan over medium-high heat, cook sausage until browned and crumbly. Add onion and pepper; cook until limp. Drain off excess fat. Add tomatoes (break up with a spoon) and simmer, uncovered, stirring frequently, until slightly thickened, about 5 to 10 minutes
   - Drain noodles and toss with basil, parsley, garlic powder, cheese, and oil. Serve sausage alongside noodles.
