   - Trim fat from pork. In a 3½- or 4-quart slow cooker combine pork shoulder, broth, onion, garlic, cumin, ground chipotle chile pepper or chili powder, and salt. Cover and cook on low heat-setting for 10 to 11 hour or on high-heat setting for 5 to 6 hours.
   - Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Remove pork from slow cooker, reserving cooking liquid. Using two forks, pull meat into coarse strands.
   - In a large bowl combine pork, ½ cup of the enchilada sauce, 2 tablespoons of the reserved cooking liquid, and the 1 tablespoon snipped cilantro. Set aside.
   - In a medium bowl combine the remaining enchilada sauce, ¼ cup of the reserved cooking liquid (discard any remaining cooking liquid), and the diced green chile peppers. Spread about ½ cup of the enchilada-green chile pepper mixture in the bottom of a 3-quart rectangular baking dish; set aside.
   - Divide pork mixture and 1½ cups of the cheese among tortillas, placing meat and cheese near the edge of each totrilla. Roll up totrillas. Place filled tortillas, seam sides down, in the prepared baking dish (place tortillas close together); top with remaining enchilada-green chile pepper mixture. Cover with foil; bake for 25 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining ½ cup cheese. Bake, uncovered. about 5 minutes more or until heated through and cheese is softened and starts to brown slightly.
