directions: |
   - Mix the blueberries, mango, onion, cilantro, lime juice, jalapeño, sugar and ¼ teaspoon salt in a bowl. Don'y worry about crushing the blueberries; you _want_ to release the juice. Set aside.
   - Heat the oil in a grill pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Season the fish with salt and pepper and place, skin side down, in the pan. COok for 4 to 5 minutes, until the skin is lightly charred and crispy. Turn and sear for another 2 to 3 minutes or until cooked through.  Avoid overcooking; the fish should flake easily with gentle touch of a fork.
   - Top each piece of fish with the blueberry mixture.
   - Makes 4 servings.
