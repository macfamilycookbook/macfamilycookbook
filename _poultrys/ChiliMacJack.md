   - Cook the turkey and garlic powder in a large skillet over medium heat, breaking up the turkey with a wooden spoon so it cooks evenly. When the turkey is no longer pink, add the beans, tomatoes with juice, macaroni, and taco seasoning. Bring to a boil.
   - Reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer for 25 minutes, stirring occasionally. During the last minute of cooking, sprinkle on the cheeses and mix so they melt into the dish.
