   - In a small bowl combine the 1 teaspoon cornstarch with broth; set aside.
   - Cut chicken into matchstick pieces and place in another small bowl.  Add the 1 tablespoon cornstarch and soy; mix well and set aside
   - Heat a wok or wide frying pan over medium-high heat.  When wok is hot, add 2 tablespoons of the oil. When oil is hot add chicken and stir-fry until chicken is opaque (about 3 minutes); remove from work and set aside.
   - Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil to pan. When oil is hot, add celery; beans, carrot, onion, add garlic; stir-fry for 1 minute. Add water; cover and cook until vegetables are just tender-crisp (about 3 minutes).
   - Return chicken to pan. Stir through chicken broth mixture once; add to wok and cook, stirring, until sauce bubbles and thickens. Stir in most of the cashews, reserving some for garnish.
   - Turn out into a serving dish and garnish with remaining nuts and coriander springs, if desired.
