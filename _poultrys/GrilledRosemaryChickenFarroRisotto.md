   - Combine 2 tablespoons oil, rosemary, and garlic in a bowl. Add chicken; toss to coat. Cover and let stand at least 30 minutes.

   - Heat a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil; swirl to coat. Add onion and thyme; sauté 4 minutes or until tender. Add reserved mushrooms and farro to pan; cook 1 minute, stirring to coat. Add wine to pan; cook 1 minute, scraping pan to loosen browned bits. Stir in 1 cup stock mixture and ¼ teaspoon salt; cook 5 minutes or until liquid is nearly absorbed, stirring constantly. Add remaining stock mixture, ½ cup at a time, stirring constantly until liquid is absorbed before adding more (about 35 minutes total). Stir in kale; cook 2 minutes. Remove pan from heat. Stir in Parmesan cheese and ¼ teaspoon pepper.
   - Remove chicken from marinade; discard marinade. Sprinkle chicken with remaining ¼ teaspoon salt and remaining ¼ teaspoon pepper. Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat.
