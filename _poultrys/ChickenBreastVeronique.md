   - Sprinkle chicken lightly with salt. IN a wide frying pan over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter. Add chicken breasts and cook, turning, until golden on each side.
   - Stir in marmalade, tarragon, and wine. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer until meat in thickest portion is no longer pink when slashed (~15 minutes). Transfer chicken to a warm serving dish, reserving juices.
   - Meanwhile, in a pan over medium heat, melt remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring, until liquid has evaporated. Set aside.
   - Add cream to pan juices. Quickly bring to a full rolling boil over medium-high heat. Mix cornstarch and water; stir into sauce. Return sauce to a boil, stirring. Add grapes, return sauce to a boil gain, and pour over chicken. Garnish with mushrooms and parsley.
