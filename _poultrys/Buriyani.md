   - Wash and soak rice for about 15 minutes. Cut the lamb or chicken into 1-inch cubes and marinate them in yogurt for about 20 minutes. Grind together the salt, cumin, garlic and ginger in a blender.
   - Heat oil, add the sliced onion and fry until golden brown. Add the meat and yogurt, the ground spices, and the whole cloves, cardamom seeds and cinnamon stick. Let this mixture stew for 8 to 10 minutes
   - Drain rice and add it to the mixture, sautéing the grains for a short time, about 5 minutes, then add 3 cups of water and cook until almost done, about 20 minutes
   - When rice is ¾ cooked, add the saffron and continue cooking over low heat until done.
