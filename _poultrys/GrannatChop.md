   - This "Grannat chop" is adapted from the Paramount Hotel, Freetown, Sierra Leone. As served there, it includes 1 pound of cubed stewing steak, but we like it just with the chicken.
   - Cut the chicken into serving pieces and dry on paper towels.  Heat the oil in a deep pan or casserole.  Brown the chicken quickly and set aside on a warm platter.  Put the onions and fresh peppers through a grinder, using the fine blade.  Slice tomatoes.  Fry these ingredients in the oil for about 5 minutes.  Return the chicken with water or stock and begin simmering.  Mix the peanut butter with tomato paste and enough broth to make smooth gravy.  Stir this into the pot.  Add salt, black pepper if desired, and thyme.  Also add ground red pepper if using.
   - Continue simmering over low heat until the chicken is tender--30 to 40 minutes.  Serve over boiled rice, garnished with whole eggs and chopped parsley.  Any of the side dishes above may be served.
