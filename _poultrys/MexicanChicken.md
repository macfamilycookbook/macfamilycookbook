   - In a shallow bowl, beat together eggs, 3 tablespoons of the salsa, and salt
   - In another shallow bowl, combine bread crumbs, chili powder, cumin, garlic salt, and oregano. Dip each chicken piece in egg mixture and roll in crumb mixture; then dip in egg mixture and roll in crumb mixture again. Set aside.
   - Place butter in a shallow baking pan (large enough to hold chicken pieces in a single layer); set pan in an oven while it’s preheating to 375°
   - When butter has melted, remove pan from oven and add chicken pieces, turning to coat with butter. Place chicken, boned, side down, in pan
   - Bake, uncovered, in a 375° oven for 35 minutes, or until meat in thickest portion is no longer pink when slashed
   - To serve, arrange chicken on a bed of lettuce, garnish with sour cream, onions, tomatoes, lime wedges, and avocado. At the table pass additional sour cream and salsa.
