directions: |
   - Place chicken breasts between 2 sheets of plastic wrap on a cutting board. With a mallet, pound breast until each is 2½ to 3 times its original size.
   - Pour just enough oil into a wide frying pan to coat bottom; place over high heat. When oil is hot, ease chicken pieces, without crowding, into pan; cook until edges become white (1 to 1½ minutes). Turn pieces over and cook until meat turns white on both sides and begins browning on second side (1 to 1½ minutes); add small amounts of oil as needed, to prevent sticking.
   - Arrange chicken pieces, slightly overlapping, in a shallow 8 by 12-inch baking dish 
   - Reduce heat to medium-high and add butter to pan; when butter has melted, add sherry and sage, scraping browned bits free. Pour evenly over chicken. (At this point, you may let stand for up to an hour.)
   - Cut ham and cheese slices into strips; distribute evenly over chicken. Sprinkle with parmesan cheese, Bake, uncovered in a 475° oven for ~6 minutes or until cheese is melted and bubbly.
