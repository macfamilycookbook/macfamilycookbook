   - Scrub the potatoes, then place them in a medium saucepan and cover with cool water. Place over medium-high heat and bring to a boil; add a large pinch of salt and cook the potatoes for about 20 minutes, until tender.
   - Meanwhile, heat a large nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat.
   - If needed, place the butter in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave on LOW for 10 to 20 seconds to soften it. 
   - Finely chop or mince the chorizo to yield about 1 cup and add to the butter. Zest a lime and add it to the bowl. Cut the limes in half and squeeze the juice from 2 halves into the bowl. Add oregano and cayenne pepper; mix well to incorporate into a nubbly paste. 
   - Use paper towel to pat the turkey cutlets dry on both sides. They should be separated into 4 equal pieces; if not, cut them in half lengthwise to form 4 even portions. Season both sides of the cutlets lighly with salt and pepper. Dive the paste evenly among the pieces, spreading the paste on top of each one.
   - Place cutelts paste side up in the skillet; cook for 6 to 8 minutes, until the cutlets are opaque about halfway through and lightly browned on the bottom. Scrape the chorizo-butter mixture off the culets into the skillet, then turn the cutlets into the skillet, the turn the culets over and cook for 5 to 6 minutes, until cooked through yet still moist inside. The butter should be metled and slightly colored from the chorizo, form a sauce. Remove from the heat.
