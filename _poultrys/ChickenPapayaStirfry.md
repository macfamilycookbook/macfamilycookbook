   - In a medium bowl, combine the soy sauce with the wine and cornstarch. Add the chicken and turn to coat.
   - Heat the oil in a wok or large skillet over moderately high heat. Add the onion, ginger and garlic and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Add the chicken and stir-fry for 5 minutes. Add the poblano and crushed red pepper and continue stir-frying until the chicken is cooked through and the poblano softens, about 3 minutes. Add the soy sauce and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chicken to a plate.
   - Add the orange juice to the wok and boil until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Return the chicken to the wok, add the papaya and stir-fry until hot, about 1 minute. Add the lemon juice, season with salt and pepper and transfer to a platter. Garnish with the scallion and serve.
