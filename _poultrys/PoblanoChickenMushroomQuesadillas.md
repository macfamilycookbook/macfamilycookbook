   - Preheat broiler to high.

   - Place chicken in a skillet, and cover with water; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Boil 1 minute. Remove pan from heat; cover and let stand 15 minutes or until chicken is done. Remove chicken from pan; cool slightly. Shred chicken with 2 forks. Add chicken to poblano.
   - Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 teaspoon oil; swirl to coat. Add mushrooms; sauté 5 minutes or until tender. Add onion and garlic; cook 2 minutes. Add mushroom mixture to poblano mixture. Stir in oregano, salt, and red pepper. Top one side of each tortilla with 2 tablespoons cheese and about ⅓ cup poblano mixture. Fold tortillas in half over filling.
   - Wipe pan clean with paper towels. Heat pan over medium heat. Add 1 teaspoon oil; swirl to coat. Add 4 quesadillas to pan, and cook 1 minute on each side or until golden. Remove quesadillas from pan, and cut each into 3 wedges. Repeat procedure with remaining 1 teaspoon oil and remaining 4 quesadillas.
