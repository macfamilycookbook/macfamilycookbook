   - Place cilantro, jalapenos, ginger and 1 tablespoons of the oil in a food processor and pulse until combined. Heat the remaining oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and eggplant and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the coconut milk, soy sauce and ½ teaspoon salt. Bring to a simmer.
   - Add the reserved cilantro mixture, the remaining salt, and the chicken. Simmer gently until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce thickens slightly, about 7 minutes. Serve over the rice.
