Since we basically never check anything that isn't somehow on the internet these days I figured it was time to take this book online. It should work on desktops, tablets, and even mobile. Oh my. On the left is all the categories and below that you'll find the recipes. Please, email me a recipe and I'll add it as soon as I can. The most recently added recipes are: 
- [Tortilla Soup](poultry.html#tortilla-soup) 
- [Spaghetti with Mushroom Herb Cream Sauce](veg.html#spaghetti-with-mushroom-herb-cream-sauce)
- [Sweet Corn & Black Bean Tacos](veg.html#sweet-corn-black-bean-tacos)
