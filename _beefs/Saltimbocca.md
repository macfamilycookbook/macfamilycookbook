   - Trim fat, bone, and connective tissue from steaks. Place meat between sheets of waxed paper and pound with a flat mallet until ¼ inch think. Divide meat into 12 pieces of fairly equal size (join scraps together if needed).
   - Top each piece of veal with several slices of prosciutto and a piece of cheese. Roll meat to enclose filling completely. Turning in the sides. Secure with small skewers.
   - Melt butter in a frying pan and blend in sage, basil, and mustard. Add meat rolls and brown quickly, turning frequently; takes 4-5 minutes. Add wine to point. Boil rapidly scraping free meat particles. Pour over veal; serve with noodles
