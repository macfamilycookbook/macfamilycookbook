directions: |
   - In a large frying pan that has a cover, sauté onion in oil until soft; add beef and garlic, and cook, stirring, until meat is brown and crumbly. Stir in tomato sauce, tomato paste, wine, and water. Add salt, oregano, pepper, and sugar, stirring until mixed. Cover pan and simmer slowly about 1½ hours.
   - Meanwhile cook noodles in boiling, salted water as directed on the package, until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain thoroughly, rinse with cold water, and drain again.
   - Arrange about ⅓ of the noodles in the bottom of a 9 by 13-inch shallow casserole dish. (Lay one layer of noodles lengthwise in the dish and the next layer crosswise. Alternate this way as you continue to arrange the dish.) Spread ⅓ of the tomato sauce over the noodles; top with ⅓ of the ricotta and mozzarella cheese. Repeat this layering two more times. Top with Parmesan.
   - Bake uncovered in a 350° oven for 30 minutes.
   - _Variation_:
   - Substitute: ½ pound of Italian sausage for ½ pound of the beef. Remove sausage casing, chop, and brown with beef.
