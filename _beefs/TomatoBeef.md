   - Cut beef with the grain into 1½ inch-wide strips. Cut each strip across the grain into ⅛-inch-thin slating slices. In a small bowl combine cornstarch, soy, sherry, water, and salt. Add beef, stirring to coat; then stir in 1½ teaspoons of the oil and let stand for 15 minutes.
   - Meanwhile, prepare Cooking sauce and set aside
   - Heat a wok or wide frying pan over high heat. When pan is hot, add 2 tablespoons of the oil. When oil is hot, add ginger and garlic and stir once. Add beef mixture and cook, stirring, until meat is browned on outside but still pink inside (~1½ minutes); remove from pan and set aside.
   - Add remaining 1½ tablespoons of oil to pan. When oil is hot, add celery and onion; cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add green pepper and continue cooking and stirring for 1 more minute, adding a few drops of water if needed. Add tomatoes and cook stirring, for 1 more minute.
   - Return heat to pan. Stir cooking sauce, add to pan, and cook, stirring until sauce boils and thickens. Serve on steamed rice.
