   - In a 5-quart kettle over medium-high heat, melt lard. Add meat, a portion at a time, and cook until browned; lift out meat and place in a bowl.
   - Add onions to pan and cook stirring, until soft. Return meat and juices to pan, add chilies, tomatoes (break up with a spoon) and their liquid, and broth. Bring to a boil; cover, reduce heat, and simmer until meat is tender when pierced (~2Â½ hours).  Season with salt to taste. 
   - Peel, pit, and dice avocado. Spoon stew into soup bowls; pass avocado and sour cream to spoon over individual servings and lime wedges to squeeze over top.
