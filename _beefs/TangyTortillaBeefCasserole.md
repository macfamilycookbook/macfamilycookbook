   - Brown ground chuck and onion in a large frying pan. Blend in tomatoes, enchilada sauce, ripe olives with liquid, salt, garlic powder, and pepper. Bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, uncovered, for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
   - Meanwhile, heat salad oil in a small frying pan in it sauté tortillas one at a time for a few seconds on each side or just until softened. Drain tortillas on paper towels; cut drained tortillas in half. Beat cottage cheese with egg.
   - Spread ⅓ of the meat sauce in a greased, shallow, 3-quart casserole; top with half the jack cheese, half the cottage cheese mixture, and half the tortilla halves, arranging each in a even layer. Repeat layering, using ⅓ more of the meat sauce and the remaining jack cheese, cottage cheese mixture, and tortilla halves. Spread with remaining meat sauce; top with Cheddar cheese and a border of crushed tortilla chips.
   - Bake, uncovered, in a 350° oven for ~ 20 minutes (~35 minutes if cold), or until casserole is thoroughly heated and cheddar cheese is melted. Cut in squares to serve.
