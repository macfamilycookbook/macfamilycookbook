   - In a frying pan sauté ground beef and onions until meat is browed and onions are soft. Stir in beans, salt, garlic powder, taco sauce, and olives; heat until bubbly.
   - Heat enchilada sauces; pour about half into an ungreased, shallow 3-quart baking dish. Pour oil to a depth of about ¼ inch in a small frying pan; heat. Dip tortillas. One at a time, in hot oil to soften; drain quickly. 
   - Place ~⅓ cup of the ground beef filling on each tortilla, and roll to enclose filling.
   - Place, seam sides down, in sauce in baking dish. Pour remaining enchilada sauce evenly over tortillas; cover with cheese. 
   - Bake, uncovered, in a 350° over for ~15 minutes or until thoroughly heated. (Or cover and refrigerate for up to 1 day; if taken directly from refrigerator, increase baking time to 45 minutes.)
   - Garnish with olive slices. Spoon sour cream and Chile sauce over each serving to taste.
