   - In a 5- to 6-quart kettle, brown beef well in oil over medium-high heat; lift out meat and set aside. Add onions to pan and cook, stirring, until limp. Add bouillon, water, tomatoes, tomato sauce, salt, cayenne, allspice, orange peel, and peanut butter; mix thoroughly. 
   - Return meat to pan, bring to a boil, reduce heat to simmer, and cook, covered, until meat is just barely, tender when pierced, about 1 hour. Stir in potatoes, cover, and cook 10 minutes. Add green pepper, and zucchini and cook, covered, until potatoes are tender enough to mash, about 10 minutes more. 
   - Serve by spooning rice into wide soup bowls, top with stew, then with peanuts and green onions. Serves 6 to 8.
